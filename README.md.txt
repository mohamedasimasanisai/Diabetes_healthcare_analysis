# 🩺 Diabetes Healthcare Analysis Project

This project analyzes health and lifestyle data from the [BRFSS 2015 dataset](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/) to uncover patterns in diabetes prevalence using **SQL, R programming**, and **Power BI**.

---

## 🔧 Tools Used
- 💻 MySQL: Data querying and aggregation
- 📊 R (ggplot2, dplyr): Data cleaning, visualization, analysis
- 📈 Power BI: Dashboard and storytelling
- 🧮 Excel: Initial cleaning, duplicate handling

## 📁 Project Structure
| Folder | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `data/` | Sample dataset (cleaned) |
| `sql/` | All SQL queries used |
| `r/` | R scripts for analysis |
| `powerbi/` | .pbix file of dashboard |
| `visuals/` | Exported charts and images |
| `README.md` | Project documentation |

## 📊 Key Questions Answered
- What % of the population is diabetic, prediabetic, or non-diabetic?
- How does BMI relate to diabetes?
- Are mental and physical health issues more common in diabetics?
- Do income and exercise impact diabetes risk?

---

## 🔍 Sample Insights
- 🔹 People with high BMI and no physical activity are at higher risk.
- 🔹 Mental and physical health issues increase as diabetes status worsens.
- 🔹 Exercise and income level show a reverse trend with diabetes risk.
